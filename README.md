# TermiPlay

**TermiPlay** is a simple cross platform console game engine, written in .NET.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Works on multiple platforms thanks to .NET 8.0.
- **GameObject:** Extend the `GameObject` class to add custom logic and renderable elements.
- **Multi-layer Rendering:** Supports multi-layer rendering, allowing you to draw layers that are automatically restored after another `GameObject` passes over them, eliminating the need for manual restoration. The rendering system only processes and renders what is necessary.

## Purpose

**TermiPlay** was developed as a short coding challenge to explore the mechanics of game engine development.
